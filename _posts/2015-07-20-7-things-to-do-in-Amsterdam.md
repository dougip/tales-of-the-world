title:  "7 things to do in Amsterdam (on a sunny day)"
---
If you are lucky enough to visit Amsterdam on a sunny day, here are some suggestions how to make the most of it. Why 7? Because that’s how many I came up with.

### 1. Rent a boat

Ok, I’ll admit. It’s easier if you know someone who can drive a boat. Or if that someone is you. Canals get busy on a sunny day and it’s easy to get in an Austin Powers “Three Point Turn” situation in the middle of Prinsengracht. Nevertheless, Boaty is a good place to have a look – cheap, easy online booking and you get the slowest boat on the canals (good for beginners). For more advanced users – check out Sloepdelen. Insider tip: If you want to grab a drink or a snack – park your boat at Amstelhaven,  sunny cafe-restaurant with a big terrace overlooking the water. Also – there is parking for boats. No kidding.

### 2. Get a bike and explore

Undeniably the best way to see the city is on a bike. Even though the topic “biking in Amsterdam” deserves it’s own separate blog post or more like “Pride and Prejudice”-sized novel, a couple of guidelines to keep in mind – Amsterdam bikers are rude (myself included), fast (myself excluded) and very impatient. Three kids in a bakfiets (to say nothing of the dog) is not uncommon. You will also see biking with an umbrella in one hand and texting with the other, pulling a suitcase behind you, biking while pulling an extra empty bike next to you, moving furniture. The list is endless.  Make sure to get a bright color bike so that you are easily avoided by locals. And on a serious note – beware that scooters and tiny cars are also allowed on the bike path.

### 3. BBQ in Vondelpark

The most famous park in Amsterdam has two designated BBQ areas that you can take advantage of. Underline most famous. Which means – it will be packed. Go early, grab a spot and guard it like your life.

### 4. Enjoy the terrace of De Ysbreeker

A 317 year old cafe-restaurant. I laugh when I see restaurants put on their menu „Since 1986” or better yet „Since 1994”. Now, „Since 1702” is something to brag about. Good food, seasonal menu and a buzzing atmosphere. Most importantly – great terrace with a view over the Amstel river! If you are lucky – you might even get friendly service. If not – just get over it. That’s how it’s done in Amsterdam.

### 5. Discover history, architecture and city legends on a Free Amsterdam Walking tour.

Highly entertaining and educational. Not sure if all stories they tell you are true, but they will explain a lot of the quirks and charm of Amsterdam. You will stand on the highest point in the city, 1.5 meters (beware of altitude sickness!), touch a bronze sculpture of boobs sticking out from the ground in The Red Light District, see the narrowest house in Amsterdam and meet some interesting travelers along the way. Good option if you are traveling on a budget. They rely on tips. Offtopic: Other walking tours worth checking out are Free Walking Tour in Berlin and Sofia.

6. Enjoy some craft beer at Brouwerij ‘t Ij.

It’s a brewery in a windmill! Nothing more to add.

7. Go to one of the many open air markets.

From local produce and fresh stroopwafel through to bike gear, reasonably priced French chickens and Indian spices– there is something for everybody. Albert Cuyp is the most popular one (open daily except Sundays), Ten Katemarkt is likely the cheapest, Noordermarkt is in a very charming area of the city with lots of little cafes and bars around.
