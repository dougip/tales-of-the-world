I might be a little biased on this one, but here are a couple of reasons why you should think twice before you pass on visiting Bulgaria. The list is not exhaustive and in no particular order of importance.

### 1. You love a good view.

Like this.

### 2. You would like to enjoy a good view

with a beer in your hand, which only cost you 50 cents. And it’s not bad, not bad at all. Better than Bud Light. Sorry AB InBev.

### 3. You suffer from a mild form of alcoholism and love a good wine.

### 4. You have been a vegetarian for 4 years,

got sick of eating eggs all day every day, and you really want to try tripe soup (in other words, lamb, pork or beef stomach soup). Best hangover food in the world. For more information on why this is healthy for you, please consult your doctor. No pictures here, I will leave this to your imagination.

### 5. You are a history geek

and would like to visit one of the world’s most ancient continuously inhabited cities – Plovdiv. Dates back to 4000 BC. Now the second largest city in Bulgaria.

### 6. You are fascinated by the complexity of communist architecture.

I find it somewhat romantic.

### 7. You are contemplating getting a job as a monk

and would like to work at the biggest Monastery on the Balkans.

### 8. You saw the movie Hitman (2007),

really liked that church they blew up and want to see it in real life. And no, that church is not in Russia, as claimed by 20th Century Fox. And if you haven’t seen the movie, don’t. Two hours I will never get back.

and the freedom to go wild camping.

### 10. You love mountain lakes

so much, you want to see seven of them in one place.

### 11. You have met some Bulgarians already

and you know we don’t bite. Except when you say that we use the Russian alphabet. And what the f*** is going on in this picture? Mystery.
